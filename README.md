# iOS File Management
An Xcode 9 project written in protocol-oriented Swift 4 code to create a wrapper for the iOS FileManager class and API. 

In the [tutorial on my blog](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/04/22/ios-file-management-with-filemanager-in-protocol-oriented-swift-4/), I'm going to show you how to develop support for manipulating files inside your app's sandboxed directory structure -- _but_, my code has been designed and written in Swift by leveraging two relatively new methodologies: protocol-oriented programming (POP) and value semantics.

Here's UML diagram showing the design of the protocol-oriented Swift code you'll find in the project:
